> It's never the wrong time to call on Toad. Early or late he's always the same fellow. Always good-tempered, always glad to see you, always sorry when you go!

## Why Mr. Toad?

My name is Todd.  When I was a teenager my younger brother would torment me by calling me "Toad"  
mainly because it made me mad.  Kids being kids it only made him do it more.  Eventually I learned to not let it 
bother me and embraced it.  Hence, `Mr. Toad`.
